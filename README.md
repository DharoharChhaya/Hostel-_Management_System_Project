## 📌 Project Overview

The **Hostel Management System** is a comprehensive web-based platform developed to automate and streamline hostel operations for both students and administrators. It eliminates manual inefficiencies by offering an intuitive interface for tasks such as room booking, fee payments, leave applications, feedback collection, and notice management.

This project was built as part of the 3rd Semester B.Tech curriculum at CHARUSAT - Devang Patel Institute of Advance Technology and Research (DEPSTAR) by a team of three students.
